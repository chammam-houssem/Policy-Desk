                    <p class="article-lead">How can AI agents act lawfully if laws are different in every country and change all the time? Moreover, acting lawfully  requires dynamic access to state registries, such as who holds copyright. In this blog, I argue that legality is not a static dataset and that to unlock the future of lawful AI, governments must invest in legality as machine-readable infrastructure.</p>

                    <p>The future of autonomous AI hinges on a critical question: will these systems be powerful but lawless, or will they be debuffed in order to be lawful? Ultimately, the most significant challenge posed by agentic AI is neither a purely legal nor a purely technical problem; it’s an infrastructure one.</p>
                    <p>Further complicating this challenge is a misguided assumption: with enough training data, we can teach artificial intelligence to understand and follow the law. Yet, even if an AI agent can read every law and every regulation, we cannot guarantee lawful action because legality is not a static dataset to be learned; it is a dynamic system of permissions, prohibitions, and recognized facts. Consequently, an AI agent’s lawfulness will never be guaranteed by its training data.</p>
                    <p>By exploring a very simple use case of agentic AI, this blog will demonstrate how lawful action requires more than knowledge of laws, but also dynamic access to authoritative, state-recognized facts. I will argue that legality is not a static dataset; it is a dynamic state that is anchored in the legal codes of countries and the list of facts that their institutions recognize, all of which are ever-changing and highly contextual.</p>
                    <p>Because of this, lawfulness is not a property that can be inferred from a dataset of legal texts; it is a dynamic state determined by an ecosystem of rules and registries. Most importantly, I call on governments to build the necessary legal infrastructure around which engineers can design lawful AI systems.</p>
        <!-- Section 1 -->
                    <h2>Problem Statement: The mundane case of Agentic Browsers & Copyright</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I got my hands on an agentic browser, a lot of questions have been on my mind:</p>
                    <p>How can AI agents distinguish between legal and illegal action? What if the law changes due to an amendment or a court ruling? Given that every country has its own laws, how can agentic systems act lawfully across the world?</p>
                    <p>These are not far-fetched questions, nor purely legal ones; they are everyday system design questions. Most critically, the failure of the current legal infrastructure manifests in the simplest of tasks. To demonstrate my point, let’s consider a very simple, mundane case: Streaming a Champions League match with an agentic browser.</p>
                    <p>The agent has a goal: “Find the best link to watch tonight’s Champions League match.” It is a simple request; however, given the current state of digital governance, it is a minefield with many possible legal complications. Most importantly, streaming rights are strictly governed by copyright and broadcasting regulations; however, these rights differ by country, by year, and sometimes by match.</p>
                    <p>While UEFA publishes a country-specific list of licensed broadcasters every year, nothing about that page makes it uniquely machine-recognizable as the rightful distributor of the copyright. To an AI agent crawling the open web, it looks no different from a polished, SEO-optimized illegal streaming site engineered to appear legitimate. Because AI cannot fundamentally “understand” legality, unless we give it something external that it is trained to recognize as the source of legal truth, the agent will optimize for convenience, not legality.</p>
                    <p>For an objective-driven agent tasked with getting me to watch the match, this ambiguity can easily put me outside of legality, for no real fault of my own. At the same time, agentic software does not need to follow a predefined algorithm; therefore, the AI system was not explicitly coded to break the law, so it is not the fault of the coder either.</p>
        <!-- Section 2 -->
                    <h2>What AI Engineers say about my Streaming Dilemma</h2>
                    <p>Based on interviews with AI engineers who were presented with my streaming dilemma, the consensus was simply “we currently can’t.” One particular engineer stated that "Unless we get something solid to work with, something like a government-issued cryptographic stamp that we train the AI agent to recognize through tools, we can't solve it at scale." In the absence of such an authoritative signal, the safest and most reliable method is to disengage before execution.</p>
                    <p>Because current architectures cannot guarantee legal compliance, the only way to avoid liability is to prevent the agent from executing the task end-to-end. This guardrail is introduced through system prompts that shape the internal logic of the AI model, instructing it not to execute actions related to topics that could involve copyright infringements (or teach someone how to steal a car, help with fraud, hack a website, etc.). Safety training and reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are often used to help the model better identify such cases, and when to exactly disengage.</p>
                    <p>In our streaming example, because the AI agent cannot distinguish a legal streaming site from an illegal one, neither can it be held accountable for choosing incorrectly; it is engineered to disengage at the final step, pointing me towards a list of possible options. In my opinion, the current approach reduces the groundbreaking capabilities of autonomous software to a simple Google search due to the absence of enabling digital infrastructure from the state. In a future blog, we will explore how this avoidance is indicative of the state of AI in the public sector.</p>

                        <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Key Insight</h3>
                        <p>Legality is not a dataset to memorize but a state to verify against authoritative rules and registries. Without machine-readable governance infrastructure, agents will default to convenience over compliance.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <!-- Section 3 -->
                    <h2>Why Legality is not a dataset</h2>
                    <p>So far, my streaming dilemma has shown that innovation is not only constrained by over-regulation but also by under-governance. More importantly, we have also learned that lawful action requires more than just knowing the law (don't break copyright law). Lawful action requires access to authoritative, state-recognized facts (who holds the streaming rights this year). This is exactly why legal compliance for AI isn't a training problem that can be solved with more training data; it's an infrastructure problem that’s external to the AI model.</p>
                    <p>As a public policy analyst, I approach legality from an institutional perspective. While acting legally often means that you did not break any law, the real-world application of this premise requires enabling frameworks and state registries. From a public policy lens, legality is best understood as a polycentric state of affairs that emerges from two interdependent pillars: legal rules and public registries.</p>
                    <p>It is polycentric because it is constructed and maintained through multiple centers of authority: Parliaments pass laws, courts interpret and contest their meaning, and professional associations, regulators, and public institutions translate them into norms and enforceable sectoral rules.</p>
                    <p>Legality is also a state of affairs because it depends on institutionally recognized facts: who owns what, who is licensed to do what, who is sanctioned, who qualifies for a benefit, and who owes what tax. These facts are the product of the legitimate process of recognition because what matters is not the fact itself, but its legal recognition and temporal validity within the state’s canonical registries.</p>
                    <p>The result is a dynamic, ever-changing system of logic, hierarchy, and authority, producing the space in which lawful action can be taken. An action becomes lawful when it is compliant to applicable laws and consistent with the relevant registries. This institutional view also clarifies why legality cannot be reduced to a dataset: both pillars must remain digitally synchronized and up to date, which cannot be internal to the AI model because it is highly contextual and ever-changing.</p>

        <!-- Section 4 -->
                    <h2>The Path Forward: Law as Infrastructure</h2>
                    <p>By exploring one mundane example, it became clear that the belief that an AI can comprehend law by ingesting legal documents is a fallacy. The era of agentic AI entails a massive public-private effort to redefine legality through machine-readable infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>To move forward and unlock a future of lawful AI agents (and robots!), we must reframe legality as an infrastructure that computationally clarifies legal rules and relevant public registries. This is not a distant dream; it is an engineering challenge that is already being solved through computational law languages like Catala in France. This programming language provides an authoritative version of social benefit rules that digital services can be built around. By replacing legacy IT systems for calculating tax and social security benefits, this language ensures that the digital service delivery applies the law without distortion or approximation.</p>
                    <p>On a final note, because legal truth is produced and can be contested by many actors, this infrastructure must be polycentric, mirroring the distributed nature of legal authority and avoiding single points of failure. By embracing a digital analogy of legality, we can build a world where AI agents are not just powerful, but predictably and verifiably lawful. This is the critical choice before us: to remain constrained by the limitations of the past, or to build the foundations for a truly autonomous future.</p>


                    <h2>The Path Forward: Law as Infrastructure</h2>
                    <p>Building lawful AI requires a public–private effort to digitize legal authority. Computational law initiatives, such as France’s Catala language for social benefits, demonstrate how code can serve as an authoritative representation of rules. Similar approaches, coupled with cryptographically authenticated registries, would let engineers design agents that can check permissions in real time.</p>
                    <p>Because legal truth is contested and distributed, this infrastructure must be polycentric, mirroring the diversity of legitimate authorities while avoiding single points of failure. By embracing legality as machine-readable infrastructure, we can build AI agents that are not only powerful but predictably and verifiably lawful.</p>
