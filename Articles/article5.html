                    <p class="article-lead">Tldr.; In Europe, data centers have become critical infrastructure because they sit at the collision point between the digital sovereignty agenda and the decarbonization agenda. That collision is producing a new governance and investment paradigm, the emerging <strong>energy–compute nexus</strong>, in which compute and electricity systems must be planned together. A recent decision by Irish regulators requiring data centers to supply electricity to the grid has brought this nexus into reality.</p>

                    <img src="../Images/Figure1-ECN.PNG" alt="The Irish Government's 17-point Large Energy-User Action Plan" style="max-width: 640px; width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 16px auto;" />

                    <h2>Data centers and the new resource governance landscape</h2>
                    <p>Data centers are not new. Long before the rise of generative AI, the expansion of cloud computing had already made them the backbone of the digital economy. Today, nearly every economic sector, from finance and logistics to public administration and healthcare, depends on them. As a result, data centers have become a core component of national resource governance, sitting at the intersection of energy systems, industrial policy, and digital infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the current AI investment rush, what has changed in recent years is not only the scale of compute demand, but its political meaning. Europe has witnessed the consolidation of a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2020/651992/EPRS_BRI(2020)651992_EN.pdf" target="_blank">digital sovereignty paradigm</a>.</p>
                    <p>In the European Union, this shift is closely linked to broader digitalization objectives, including the ambition to strengthen domestic cloud capacity and secure critical data infrastructure inside national borders. Compute is increasingly treated as a strategic asset underpinning state capacity and geopolitical autonomy, which positions it as <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/aktuelles/summit-on-european-digital-sovereignty-delivers-landmark-commitments-for-a-more-competitive-and-sovereign-europe-2394368" target="_blank">a system of strategic importance nearly on par with decarbonization and energy independence.</a></p>
                    <p>At the same time, Europe's decarbonization agenda has become both more ambitious and more binding. The European Union has committed to achieving a net-zero economy by 2050, a target made legally binding through the <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/european-climate-law_en" target="_blank">European Climate Law</a>. Interim objectives include a reduction of at least 55% in net greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (relative to 1990 levels), with proposals under discussion to raise this target to <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/climate-strategies-targets/2040-climate-target_en" target="_blank">90% by 2040</a>. Since the Russia–Ukraine war, the energy transition has also been increasingly framed as a strategy to reduce exposure to imported fossil fuels and strengthen strategic autonomy.</p>
                    <p>These two agendas, digital sovereignty and deep decarbonization, are advancing in parallel, but not independently. Their interaction is giving rise to an emerging energy–compute nexus, a paradigm in which energy systems and data center operations can no longer be planned in isolation, but must be designed and optimized as an integrated system.</p>
                    <p>This regulatory shift matters because the scale of energy demand from data centers is no longer marginal to electricity systems. According to the IEA's groundbreaking <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai" target="_blank">Energy and AI report</a>, data centers' energy demand is projected to rise from 1.5% of global electricity use in 2024 to 3% by 2030 (with Al driving 30% of this growth). Goldman Sachs Research reinforces this, forecasting a <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030" target="_blank">165% increase in data center power demand</a> by 2030 compared to 2023 levels. This growth is being driven by an unprecedented wave of capital expenditure. According to Moody's, six hyperscalers, <a href="https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/insights/credit-risk/outlooks.html" target="_blank">Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Oracle, Meta, and CoreWeave</a>, spent close to 400 billion dollars on data center infrastructure in 2025.</p>

                    <img src="../Images/Figure2-ECN.png" alt="Projected electricity demand growth from announced data center goals in European countries" style="max-width: 640px; width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 16px auto;" />
                    <p style="text-align: center;">Figure 2: Projected electricity demand growth from announced data center goals in European countries (left axis) and share of electricity demand (right axis). <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/overcoming-energy-constraints-is-key-to-delivering-on-europe-s-data-centre-goals" target="_blank">Source: IEA</a></p>

                    <p>Yet, this expansion is not purely market-driven. Governments are racing to encourage domestic data center development as part of broader digital sovereignty strategies. In large European economies such as Germany and France, fully <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/overcoming-energy-constraints-is-key-to-delivering-on-europe-s-data-centre-goals" target="_blank">implementing these ambitions</a> would imply data center electricity demand equivalent to roughly 5 to 10 percent of today's peak load, depending on siting choices and cooling technologies. In countries with high renewable penetration and strong data center investment pipelines, such as Spain or the Netherlands, this share could reach around 10 percent.</p>
                    <p>With cumulative global investment in data centers projected to <a href="https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/insights/credit-risk/outlooks.html" target="_blank">exceed $3 trillion over the next five years</a>, even incremental improvements in energy market alignment and grid flexibility can translate into large sustainability and system-efficiency gains.</p>

                    <h2>The emerging energy–compute nexus</h2>
                    <blockquote class="article-quote">This nexus is sometimes referred to as the "energy–AI nexus." While AI is a major and fast-growing driver of compute demand, this framing, in my opinion, is misleading. Data centers do not exist for AI alone. They underpin cloud computing, data storage, financial infrastructure, and digital communications. Approaching this nexus solely through the lens of AI risks obscuring the fact that what is at stake is not a single technology, rather than addressing the expansion of compute as a general-purpose infrastructure.</blockquote>
                    <p>The emergence of the energy-compute nexus reflects a growing recognition that compute infrastructure is both energy-intensive and strategically indispensable. As governments push to localize data, cloud services, and AI capabilities, the physical constraints of electricity systems increasingly shape the pace and geography of digital growth. In practice, this means that questions of grid capacity, renewable integration, and long-term energy planning are becoming inseparable from decisions about where and how data centers are built.</p>
                    <p>This integrated perspective is now being institutionalized through European regulation. As data center deployment accelerates, European energy policy is tightening, and a more coherent pan-European framework for governing data centers is taking shape.</p>
                    <p>At the center of this emerging regulatory compact is the revised <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-targets-directive-and-rules/energy-efficiency-directive_en" target="_blank">Energy Efficiency Directive</a>, which mandates standardized and publicly accessible reporting of key performance indicators for all data centers with an installed power demand above 500 kW. These requirements are reinforced by the EU's broader sustainable finance architecture, notably the <a href="https://e3p.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/publications/assessment-framework-data-centres-context-activity-81-taxonomy-climate-delegated-act" target="_blank">EU Taxonomy</a> and the <a href="https://hyperviewhq.com/blog/guide-to-new-csrd-regulation-for-data-center-operators/" target="_blank">Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive</a>. Together, these instruments establish an EU-wide reporting framework capturing data on electricity consumption, water use, power usage effectiveness, and waste heat recovery. In doing so, they embed data centers firmly within Europe's energy and resource governance systems. Data centers are no longer treated as neutral background infrastructure, but as regulated actors with material system impacts and responsibilities.</p>

                    <h2>Ireland at the heart of the Energy-Compute Nexus</h2>
                    <p>In Ireland, this nexus has already translated into concrete policy change. This shift is unfolding against the backdrop of mounting energy infrastructure constraints across Europe's most attractive data center hubs. In established global centers such as Frankfurt, London, Paris, and Dublin, grid saturation has reached critical levels. This reflects a structural mismatch between the rapid deployment cycles of hyperscale data centers and the much slower timelines associated with traditional electricity grid expansion cycles. In several locations, new data centers now face <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai" target="_blank">average grid connection wait times of 7 to 10 years,</a> effectively turning access to power into a binding constraint on digital growth.</p>
                    <p>Against this backdrop, and after 4 years of a de facto ban on new data center development in the greater Dublin area due to grid capacity concerns, the ban has recently been lifted following the introduction of a new regulatory framework and a strategic plan.</p>
                    <p>Under a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-12/ireland-set-to-end-moratorium-on-new-power-links-to-data-centers?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank">new framework produced by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities</a> in December, 2025, new data centers seeking a grid connection must install on-site generation or battery systems capable of meeting their full electricity demand and provide power back to the national grid when needed. The new guidelines also require that at least 80% of the electricity needed to operate a new data center must come from new renewable energy sources.</p>
                    <p>A few weeks later, on January 13, 2026, the Irish government unveiled a new <a href="https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/publications/publication-files/leap-large-energy-user-action-plan.pdf" target="_blank">Large Energy User Action Plan</a> that calls for establishing green energy parks where large consumers of electricity will have easy access to clean power. This will facilitate co-locating the most energy-intensive industrial developments with indigenous renewable energy supply.</p>
                    <p>Taken together, these measures represent a regulatory materialization of the energy-compute nexus. They explicitly follow the logic of integrated nexus thinking that has developed over the past two decades. By proactively planning for the co-location of energy-intensive industrial sites, including data centers, with renewable generation and supporting energy infrastructure, this approach aims to improve coordination between public grid investment and private capital deployment. In doing so, it represents a high level of integrated planning that has the potential to bring back balance to the digitalization and decarbonization imperatives.</p>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>Nexus thinking is powerful because it does more than identify hidden interdependencies and potential constraints across systems. When applied proactively, it also creates the conditions to turn these challenges into opportunities by integrating them into planning and investment decisions rather than treating them as constraints to be managed.</p>
                    <p>Recent regulatory developments in Ireland illustrate this logic in practice. While it is too early to claim that this approach will be uniformly replicated across Europe, the Irish case reflects the broader integrated resource management direction across Europe.</p>
                    <p>What is certain is that this emerging energy–compute nexus sets the stage for a deeper rethinking of how digital infrastructure can support, rather than strain, decarbonization objectives. The era of the data center as a standalone, passive consumer of municipal utilities is coming to an end. In its place, a new model is emerging in which compute infrastructure is planned, regulated, and operated as an integrated component of the energy system itself.</p>
                    <p>In the next pieces in this series, I will examine the operational and business dimensions of this energy–compute nexus, focusing on how integrated energy and compute planning can unlock flexibility, reduce system stress, and create new sources of value. In a later contribution, I will widen the analytical lens further by extending this framework to the water–energy–compute nexus, an area that remains underdeveloped in both policy and academic debates, but is essential for completing the picture.</p>
